## What is an interface?

Think of an interface like a set of rules or a list of things that something should be able to do. 
It tells you what actions are possible but doesnâ€™t say how to do them.

## Why use interfaces?

Interfaces help different parts of a program work together without knowing the details of how each part works. 

## What's the difference between Class and Interface?

Implementation: Classes provide implementation; interfaces do not. Classes can be instantiated, while interfaces cannot.

State: Classes can have state (data); interfaces cannot.

Purpose: Classes define how something works, while interfaces define what something can do.

 
While interfaces and abstract classes can seem similar, they serve different purposes in object-oriented programming. 
An interface is not just an abstract class with an empty body; it defines a different kind of contract for implementing behaviors.

## Reminder - what is a businesss logic?

Business Logic = The rules and decisions that define how the program behaves to meet specific business needs.

Why is it important? - Because it tells the program what to do in different situations, just like a set of instructions for making your program handle real-world scenarios!

## What are mocks and mockitos?

Mocks and libraries like Mockito are used in testing to create "fake" versions of objects so that you can test your code without needing the real dependencies. This makes testing easier, faster, and more reliable.

Mockito is a popular library in Java used to create and work with mocks.
